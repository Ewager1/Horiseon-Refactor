To refactor source code to be clean and meet accesability standards with the following guidelines.

2. HTML elements follow a logical structure.
3. Images have alt text.
4. CSS follows the same sequential order as the html.
5. There is a relavent title.
6. There are no unnesasary redundencies in code.
